      <h4>Where are the winningest cities in America?</h4>

      <p>Ships. Boats. Natties. Bragging rights. Whatever you call them, winning titles means something. Sports teams (and indeed, franchises, dynasties, and lives) spend years building and rebuilding, fighting to win championships, hunting for the elusive
        title. After all, there’s only one every year (unless you play college football).<sup><a href="#fn1-25547" id="fnr1-25547" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> When a team finally nabs one, when they finally win it all, things happen.
        Players earn more money, coaches get more slack, and egos run rampant. But for their cities, it’s a validation. Diehard fans finally see their girls or boys bring it home, bringing an end to sometimes years and years of waiting. The bandwagons
        can stay fully loaded, stable in their choice of team. And everyone can take off their <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046390_2046393_2046355,00.html">damn cheese hats</a> and <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/sports/why-the-watermelons">watermelon heads</a>        and breathe a little. </p>

      <p>Whether or not a city sees an economic boost following their teams’ success (<a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&amp;context=honors">there’s some disagreement about this</a>), the fans celebrate. Parades, parties,
        and streets full of confetti combine with intense media coverage to bring glory (and occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls_Championship_riots">infamy</a>) to any town, no matter the size, especially when they’re back-to-back
        (-to-back).

      <p>When Golden State won their third NBA championship in four years a few weeks ago, it got me thinking. What's the winningest city in sports?</p>

      <p>It’s not hard to find some answers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/upshot/boston-and-pittsburgh-americas-most-successful-sports-cities.html">The Upshot</a> calls Boston and Pittsburgh America's most successful sports cities, while Green
        Bay, home to 13 NFL ships, is actually known as <em>Titletown</em>, as <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2011/12/why-they-call-green-bay-titletown/753/">Citylab</a> explained in 2011. Tuscaloosa is almost unanimously referred to as the winningest
        city in college sports, where the Crimson Tide have won a combined 27 NCAA titles over five disciplines. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/sports/title-towns-usa-winningest-cities-in-the-four-major-sports-over-the-last-100-years/2048/?noredirect=on">Brian Gross</a>        of the Washington Post mapped out the winners of the four major North American Sports over the last 100 years (as of 2016), finding New York (and Newark) atop the list, with 55 pro titles combined. In 2008, ESPN named Valdosta, Georgia <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/titletown/index?DB_OEM_ID=3350">Titletown USA</a>        — a town that didn’t even show up in my research<sup><a href="#fn2-25547" id="fnr2-25547" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> (Green Bay placed third and Beantown fifth, but this was of course, mostly a fan vote). Opinions on the
        most dominant city in sports are abundant, but it’s clear to me that when want to find the winningest city in America, it depends who you ask, what you include, and when you start counting.</p>

      <p>To answer my question, I looked at every championship ever won in the big four pro leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and the NHL, and their predecessors), Major League Soccer, Canada’s CFL, and the three most played sports by each gender in the NCAA’s Division
        I (I had to stop somewhere, right?). There are some specifics I outline in the footnotes, but for the most part, this includes every professional title won in North America, and every NCAA Div I title of note. For the purposes of this study, metro
        areas are not considered, meaning every city gets its own title count. Anaheim, for instance, is not part of LA, Newark is not part of New York City, and Cambridge is not part of Boston.</p>

      <p>Below I look at the last 148 years of sport (since the first college football national championship) and expand upon the Post’s map to find North America’s <strong>Titletowns</strong> — its winningest cities, the places which have known the most
        athletic success, the capitals of championship.</p>

      <p>No spoilers, though. Scroll on to find them for yourself.</p>

    <div class="story">
      <p>Professional sports championships begin with Major League Baseball’s World Series, the first organized version of which was handed out in October of 1903 when the Boston Red Sox defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three. This was the start
        of something big for both cities — 148 years later, Beantown sits in third when it comes to pro championships, with 37, and the City of Bridges earns a close tenth, with 16. The Northeast United States is a major hotbed for MLB titles, where six
        cities and eleven teams have won 61 World Series. More than four of every ten World Series goes to the Yankees, Mets, Giants (before they moved west), Dodgers (before they moved west too!), Red Sox, Americans, Braves (the Boston ones), Athletics
        (the Philly ones), Phillies, Pirates, or Orioles. </p>

      <p>While the West Coast got off to a slow start, not actually winning a pro title until 1951 (the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL), it has a much more significant impact on basketball than any other pro sport. Los Angeles has won eleven NBA Championships,
        while Oakland has chipped in with four (Golden State what’s up). Boston crushes this category as well, however, with 17 titles. The Lakers and the Celtics collectively have won almost 40% of the time.</p>

      <p>Pro football, the only one of the big four to have a geographic hotspot outside of the New York/Boston monopoly, is where Green Bay makes its case. The smallest market in the league, this small town in Eastern Wisconsin, is home to a whopping 14
        NFL Championships/Super Bowls. Chicago is up there too, where the Bears have won ten. </p>

      <p>The NHL’s previous winners are far less spread out, focusing mainly on the northeastern states and eastern provinces. Montreal has won 27 Stanley Cups, 14 more than second-place Toronto. Combine that with nine Grey Cups, and it’s good enough to
        bump the Quebecois city into fifth all-time, pro <em>and</em> NCAA, in which it has no competing teams. Toronto, winner of 24 Grey Cups, 2 World Series, and one MLS championship sits in third. </p>

      <p>While Los Angeles doesn’t sit particularly high on the winners’ list in pro sports (sixth, four wins back of fifth place Chicago), its success in college athletics far and away leads the pack. LA, home to both the University of Southern California
        and the University of California - Los Angeles, has won 39 NCAA Div I titles (13 in men’s baseball, 11 in men’s basketball, ten in men’s football, one in women’s soccer, and four in women’s volleyball). Combine this with 25 pro championships,
        and LA becomes the winningest city in America.</p>

      <p>Chapel Hill, North Carolina, however, punches way out of its league. Home to just over 57,000 residents, the city has won 28 titles, all of them in the NCAA. That’s the second most in college sports, and good enough for seventh overall. Towns like
        this one — Notre Dame, IN (University of Notre Dame), New Haven, CT (Yale University), Tuscaloosa, AL (University of Alabama), Mansfield, CT, (University of Connecticut), and Stanford, CA (Stanford University) — along with small towns in Texas,
        Nebraska, Ohio, Michigan, and the Carolinas — speckle this map green, leading to a map of hot spots more widespread than that of the pros.</p>

        <p>The line chart above is cumulative, meaning that every time a city wins a title, its line goes up a notch (where the x-axis is equivalent to time, 1870-2018). The steeper the line (read, Los Angeles, 1963 to 2014, or 58 boats in 51 years) the
          quicker the city is earning those ships. The longer the line, horizontally (see Philly from 1896, when UPenn won the men’s football title, until 2018, when the Eagles won their first Super Bowl), the more consistent or enduring the city is.
          Late bloomers, like Baton-Rouge, Louisiana, which won its first title in 1909, its second in 1959, and a whole slew of them between 1993 and 2009 are also evident after digging through the data.</p>

        <p>Of the 199 cities represented, 57 have never won a title at all, while 146 have never won a pro title. 20 teams account for more than half of all championships ever won.</p>

        <h4>Where to next?</h4>
        <p>While I did what I set out to do, locating the winningest city in sports, I seem to have opened up a few more doors along the way. Going forward, I’d love to expand this study to compare the number of championships to population, or metro areas
          to titles. <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2011/12/why-they-call-green-bay-titletown/753/">Citylab</a> did something along those lines in 2011, using a location quotient to compare metro areas. Richard Florida points out in that article
          that Green Bay earns its name as Titletown, winning 22 <em>times</em> the number of championships it should be expected to, based on its location as a metro area.</p>

        <p>I also collected data on final four and semi-finals appearances for every year we have a record for it. There’s a lot of potential in this data as well, and it somewhat went ignored in this piece. Comparing cities by win percentage in playoff
          appearances, and narrowing this down to semi-finals and finals could give us a better idea of just how successful cities are. This also brings up the question of win percentages in general. Cities like New York and Boston have had pro teams
          since the beginning of pro teams, so it makes sense they’d top our lists, but cities like Las Vegas, who just got their first pro hockey team, are relatively new to the scene. Win percentages may let us compare cities more evenly, as opposed
          to this study which looks at sheer numbers.</p>

        <p>Dynasties and droughts. This was my initial sketch for this project, and while I decided to build a foundation with the study above, this is still floating around in my head. Something like this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/28/eli-manning-milestone/index.html">New York Times piece</a>          could give us a lot of insights into the idea of dynasties and droughts, curses and streaks.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
      <p>Data was collected from <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/">Hockey-Reference</a>, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/">Basketball-Reference</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/">Baseball-Reference</a>,
        <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/">Pro-Football-Reference</a> (NFL Superbowls), <a href="http://www.worldfootball.net/winner/usa-major-league-soccer/">World Football</a> (MLS), <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/history/football/fbs">NCAA</a>,
        <a href="http://www.cfhof.ca/grey-cup-winners/">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a>, <a href="https://www.allbrackets.com">All Brackets</a>, and <a href="http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf">NFL</a>,
        and combined into one giant database of championships, in order, by league and sport. I listed the winning team, the runner-up, and the two remaining semi-finalists for each title, and cross-referenced this with a list of every franchise to have
        existed for each pro league and every college to compete in each NCAA sport. I then (occasionally manually) added city data to each entry and used the Google Maps API to find their coordinates and assign a list of teams to every city. Finally,
        I created a matrix listing the cumulative title count for every city for every year, which led to the first chart above. The majority of this was done in Python (except for the Google Maps API part, done in Google Sheets). </p>

      <p>I did not combine cities, opting to compare the sheer number of titles won by each, individual city. Newark is not part of New York, Anaheim is not part of LA, and Oakland is not part of San Fran. </p>

      <p>I included the four major pro leagues in North America: this includes teams that played at least one game in the MLB (including the AL and the NL, but only organized, modern World Series played after 1903); the NBA (and its direct predecessor, the
        BAA, which played from 1946 to 1949); the NFL (and the APFL, its original name, but not the AFL before its merger with the NFL, as these records are disputed); and the NHL. I also included the CFL (and its early iterations, known as the IRFU,
        WIFU, OFU, and CRU, and the league’s American expansion) and the MLS as the continent’s other two professional sports leagues that <em>we have records for</em>. I did not include any leagues that are considered feeder leagues (like AAA baseball),
        farm leagues (like the AHL), junior leagues (WHL, OHL, QMJHL), or otherwise amateur leagues. I also included NCAA as the top level college programs are considered by many to be (almost) comparable to pro sports and are (almost) always involved
        in Titletown discussions. I limited this to the three most played sports by each gender, because, well, you’ve got to stop somewhere.</p>

      <p>The seven maps and two charts were developed in <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, using Susie Lu’s <a href="http://d3-annotation.susielu.com/">d3.annotations</a>, FontAwesome, jQuery, and jQuery Autocomplete. Also, thanks to <a href="https://officeofjane.com/">Office of Jane</a>        for the slider block used on the main map, Mike Bostock for the Voronoi method used on the first chart, and The Pudding for the (undeniable) inspiration on the final chart above.</p>
