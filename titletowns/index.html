            <p class="intro-fade">When Golden State won its third NBA championship in four years a few months ago, I started thinking. Of all the cities to field a professional or college level team in the last 150 years, which is the winningest?</p>

            <p class="intro-fade"><span id="worldseries-winner">And now, with the Red Sox recent World Series win, I’m wondering, is it Boston?</span> <span id="groundrules-user-city">Or maybe it’s Green Bay, WI</span>, a city literally <em>called</em>
              Titletown.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-fade">I’ve dug through the data and come up with three ways to determine the winningest cities in North America, a.k.a. titletowns. Before we dive in though, we need some ground rules: in this essay, I look at 458 pro
              sports teams<sup><a href="#fn1-11829" id="fnr1-11829" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> from the MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS, and CFL, and 1917 div I college teams<sup><a href="#fn2-11829" id="fnr2-11829" title="see footnote"
                  class="footnote">2</a></sup>. All told, these teams have represented 199 cities and played for 996 sports championships since 1870.</p>

            <p class="intro-fade">We totally get that not everyone will agree on what sports to include, or what time frame to look at. No problem, you’ll have the opportunity to set your own parameters a later on. Look out for these filters in the
              bottom left of your screen. When it comes to making a titletown, <strong>you define it</strong>.</p>

              <h4>Actual Titles</h4>
              Our first way to determine titletowns is to simply look at the numbers &mdash; total championships won by a metro area. And in this case, looking at all sports between 1870 and 2018, <span class="offsetcolour" id="step0_leader">Greater
                Los Angeles, CA</span> is the winningest city in North America.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-index="1">
            <div class="inner">
              This makes sense, considering <span class="step1_leader">Greater Los Angeles</span> teams have played a combined <span id="step1_totalseasons">x</span> seasons <span id="step1_local"></span>. Based on that, should we expect <span id="step1_totaltitles">74</span>
              titles?

          </div>
          <div class="step" data-index="2">
            <div class="inner">
              Actually, no. We&rsquo;d expect them to have won <span id="step2_lessormore">a lot fewer</span>. By giving each team in a given season an equal chance of winning its respective championship, and adding those odds up over time, we
              can get an
              expected number of championships. Combining these for each metro area to field a team, we can compare the expected to actual wins differential for every city in our dataset. <span id="step2_leader">Greater Los Angeles</span>
              should have won <span id="step2_howmany">24</span><span id="step2_local"></span><span id="step2_howmany_local"></span>.

              <h4>Conversion Rates</h4>
              But what about a metro area’s performance over time? How has the idea of a titletown changed over the past 150 years?
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-index="6">
            <div class="inner">
              Let’s consider a metro area’s conversion rate — that is, how well a city’s teams perform when given a real shot at winning it all. Between 1870 and 1920, in all sports, the best teams came from New Haven (the Yale Bulldogs competed in
              47 seasons, winning 17 times, or in 36% of their attempts).
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-index="7">
            <div class="inner">
              Between 1920 and 1970, however, New Haven falls off the map, replaced by New York, whose teams won a title in 35 of 51 combined seasons (a 69% conversion rate!), and Toronto, which won in 23 of 51 for a 45% conversion.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-index="8">
            <div class="inner">
              In the last 48 years though, it’s all Los Angeles. As a city, LA has won 50 championships since 1970 — a conversion rate of 104% — and finished in the final four or better <strong>131</strong> times.</br></br>
              So where’s the real titletown here? The winningest city in North America has changed over time. Let’s look at metro areas that have been good (or bad) for a long time.

              If we look at streaks of final four appearances, we can see <em>how long</em> a city has been good. And if we look at dynasties — championships in a row, — we can see how long a metro area has been <em>great</em>. Maybe more
              importantly though, we can look at dry spells. Every city goes some time without making the top four, but for me, a metro area that can avoid that as much as possible is a real titletown.

              Bigger metro equals bigger market, and a bigger market can translate to bigger payrolls. Teams in these places can spend the big bucks on superstars,
              tempting them away from smaller markets, their cost spread out across more fans (read: consumers).

            <div class="inner">
              So how does this relationship factor into the makings of a titletown? In our first case above, we looked at how many championships we’d expect a city to win based on the number of seasons its teams had played. Now we’ll look at
              how many we’d expect based on its population.

              We do this using a location quotient. This compares a metro area’s titles per capita to the overall. This graph plots number of titles vs. population size, while circle sizes represent a metro area’s TLQ, or its performance above
              expectation. The more blue the circle is, the better a city is doing; the more red, the worse.

          <p>Data was collected from <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/">Hockey-Reference</a>, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/">Basketball-Reference</a>, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/">Baseball-Reference</a>,
            <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/">Pro-Football-Reference</a> (NFL Superbowls), <a href="http://www.worldfootball.net/winner/usa-major-league-soccer/">World Football</a> (MLS), <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/history/football/fbs">NCAA</a>,

            and then combined into a database of championships, in order, by league and sport. I listed the winning team, the runner-up, and the two remaining semi-finalists for each title, and cross-referenced this with a list of every franchise to
            have existed for each pro league and every college to compete in each NCAA sport. I then (sometimes manually) added city data to each entry and assigned a list of teams and their results to every city. Finally, I created a matrix
            including the cumulative title count for every city for every year, which led to the first chart above. The majority of this was done in Python and Google Sheets.</p>

          <p>In early drafts of this project, I did not combine cities, opting to compare the sheer number of titles won by each, individual city. Newark was not part of New York, Anaheim was not part of LA, and Oakland was not in San Fran. After
            some feedback from the good folks here at the Pudding, we decided to make some changes, joining nearby metro areas like Cambridge and Boston, and Chapel Hill and Raleigh, to provide a clearer picture of what a titletown is. To do this, I
            used the United States metropolitan statistical areas to put each city in its corresponding metro area and manually edited for weird things like San Jose technically being part of the Bay Area — who knew, right?</p>

          <p>All charts were developed using d3.js, using Susie Lu’s d3.annotations, Justin Palmer’s d3-tip, Font Awesome, jQuery, and jQuery Autocomplete. </p>

                1903); the NBA (and its direct predecessor, the BAA); the NFL (and the APFL, its original name, but not the AFL before its merger with the NFL, as these records are disputed); and the NHL. I also included the CFL (and its American
                expansion, and early iterations, which all competed for Grey Cup) and the MLS as the other two pro leagues that <em>we have reliable records for</em>. Teams that have relocated or transferred ownership are counted as one franchise
                and now-defunct franchises that played at least one game are included. <a href="#fnr1-11829" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

            <li id="fn2-11829">
              <p>We also looked at the NCAA’s Div I, which is considered by many to be (almost) comparable to pro sports and are (almost) always involved in titletown discussions. I limited this to the three most played sports by each sex, because,
                well, you’ve got to stop somewhere. <a href="#fnr2-11829" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
